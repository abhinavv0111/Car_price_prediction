# Car Price Prediction Project
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices using a dataset containing various features such as fuel type, seller type, transmission, etc. The prediction is made using a Linear Regression model.

## Project Structure
car_price_prediction.py: The main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
car_price_data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Usage
 ## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
## Install the required libraries:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the car_price_prediction.py script:

python car_price_prediction.py
## Model Evaluation
The project uses a Linear Regression model, and the performance is evaluated using the R-squared metric.

## Data Preprocessing
- Conversion of categorical variables to numerical values.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Results
- Training Set R-squared: 0.87
- Testing Set R-squared: 0.83
# Visualization
- Scatter plots comparing actual prices with predicted prices for both training and testing sets.
